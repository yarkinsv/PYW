PlanYourWeek
============

## Website for planning physical, educational and other tasks by weeks

There are a ton of time managers and productivity planners. Why did I decide to create yet another one?
Because I want the tool that matches exactly the needs I have. And I don't need extensive functionality, 
that actually only disturbs me. My concept is this: every day has three sections - one for physical activities, 
one for educational activities, and one for random single tasks.

You can click on a section and create/edit corresponding activity. 

Physical activity is for controlling my gym routine. I need to schedule appropriate workout by day of week, and track
my weights by exercise.

Educational activity is for staying focused on my education. Normally it is MOOC or some personal project. 
When I am learning something I found it is very important to note new things I learned from previous exercise,
so I could read it later before starting new session.

Single tasks might be just random stuff I have to do. So this section is helpful to not forget about some 
important thing I want to do this day.
